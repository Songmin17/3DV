fit_3d.py:

gt joints: joints
conf: ???
sph_regs: interpen for gender 
keypoint info?? = joints


ablation study: 


fit_3d:
1. how to adjust the weights for pose + shape prior? What are some good weights?
    see paper 

2. where in the code are the gt joint and the estimated joint? 
run_single_fit input: j2d (predicting these to be the gt joints)
opt_j2d: optimized joints 


3. why isn't anything being saved to opt_viz directory? (maybe wait for all 20 images)

4. what is taking so long to process all the images?

5. why isn't len(joints) equal to len(optimized_jt)? 14 vs 25 

overall pipeline in code: 

fit_3d:
in main: 
joints (gt)
conf confidence interval for joints 
load img 
run_single_fit on img -> obtain params, images (empty list)
params: 
    cam_t: cam trans. vector 
    f: ?? 
    pose: 
    betas: 
    * opt_j2d: optimized joints
    * verts:
    * faces:


1. find_bbox: use optimized joints 
    what: bbox algorithm 

    

2. drawKeyPoints 

how to debug: do these on input img + save the img
